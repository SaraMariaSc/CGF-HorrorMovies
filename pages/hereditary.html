Annie attends her mother's funeral with her husband Steven (Gabriel Byrne) and their kids Peter (Alex Wolff) and Charlie (Milly Shapiro). Annie gives a eulogy for her mother, pointing out that there are people there that she doesn't know and that Ellen was into things that Annie knew little about.<br><br>At Charlie's school, a bird hits a window during a test. After class, Charlie swipes a pair of scissors and cuts the bird's head off. She brings it home and makes a doll with it. In her room, she notices a blue flash of light surrounding her. She then walks outside and sees what appears to be Ellen surrounded by flames before Annie scolds her and pulls her back into the house. Peter asks Annie if he can borrow one of his parents' cars to go to a party, and Annie makes him take Charlie with him.<br><br>At the party, Peter leaves Charlie alone while he goes to smoke weed. She eats chocolate cake with nuts in it and she begins to suffer an allergic reaction before going into anaphylactic shock. Peter rushes Charlie to the hospital, and she opens the window to stick her head out and breathe better. Peter sees an animal on the side of the road and swerves hard, causing Charlie's head to hit a telephone pole, decapitating her. Peter sits in shock and silence before driving home slowly and quietly going home. The next morning, he hears Annie's blood-curdling scream as she discovers Charlie's headless body in the car. We even get a gruesome look at her severed head on the side of the road as it is being devoured by ants.<br><br>Annie becomes detached and inconsolable after Charlie's death, avoiding Peter and even sort of hating him. Peter himself is wracked with guilt to the point where he suffers a painful physical reaction at school while smoking weed with his friends. He even appears to hallucinate seeing Charlie in his room, down to hearing the tongue-clicking sound she would always make. Annie returns to the support group and then meets a woman named Joan (Ann Dowd), who invites Annie to speak with her because she knows what it is like to lose a child.<br><br>Annie encounters a woman named Joan who helps her perform a seance to contact Charlie, only for supernatural events to plague the family. It is soon revealed that Ellen and Joan were part of a cult that tried to summon the demon Paimon into the body of a male in the family, but he had previously settled in Charlie's body, so nearly everything that happens to the Graham family was orchestrated by Ellen and Joan.<br><br>After Annie attempts to get rid of the hauntings, her husband Steven is burned alive, and her own body gets briefly possessed to kill herself before Peter jumps out a window to his own death. Paimon uses this as an opportunity to take over his body and join the cult where they bow to him.";
